~ Leveraging Social Media for Social Good ~

Ecotegrity is a social media climate change app that aims to raise awareness about global warming as well as to get people to take action by organizing events on the app. In the app, users can share blog posts, discuss and organize climate change related events.

Designer: Beatrix Cendana
Developers: Jolie Ip, Tasha Ip, Ishika Prashar

Ecotegrity was created by us through participation in the Dandilyonn SEEDs Program 2020.

We are incredibly grateful to the program, especially Archana and Pravin for introducing us to mobile development.

Ecotegrity is created for the young adult or college student who lives in influencer culture and spends time connecting with others through social media. Our goal with the app is to utiilize social media specifically for climate change issues to cultivate discussions that the world will participate in through influencer followings and wanting to spend time with friends for meaningful causes.

Check out these videos of our prototype and all that we hope to implement and publish to the App Store in the near future. Don't forget to look through our code and see the progress we have made so far as well! Thank you!
