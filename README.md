Ecotegrity was created by us through participation in the Dandilyonn SEEDs Program 2020.

We are incredibly grateful to the program, especially Archana and Pravin for introducing us to mobile development.

Ecotegrity is created for the young adult or college student who lives in influencer culture and spends time connecting with others through social media. Our goal with the app is to utiilize social media specifialy for climate change issues to cultivate discussions that the world will participate in through influencer followings and wanting to spend time with friends for meaningful causes.
